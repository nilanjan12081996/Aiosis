            Arbitration Agreement carefully. It is part of your contract with We
            and affects your rights. It contains procedures for MANDATORY
            BINDING ARBITRATION AND A className ACTION WAIVER. Applicability of
            Arbitration Agreement. All claims and disputes in connection with
            the Terms or the use of any product or service provided by the We
            that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be
            resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the
            terms of this Arbitration Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed to, all
            arbitration proceedings shall be held in English. This Arbitration
            Agreement applies to you and the We, and to any subsidiaries,
            affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors,
            and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or
            beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.

          <p className="pb-4 text-[#acacac]">
            Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution. Before either
            party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other
            party a written Notice of Dispute describing the nature and basis of
            the claim or dispute and the requested relief. A Notice to the We
            should be sent to our contact email. After the Notice is received,
            you and the We may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute
            informally. If you and the We do not resolve the claim or dispute
            within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party
            may begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement
            offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until
            after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award to which
            either party is entitled.
          </p>
          <p className="pb-4 text-[#acacac]">
            Arbitration Rules. Arbitration shall be initiated through the
            American Arbitration Association, an established alternative dispute
            resolution provider that offers arbitration as set forth in this
            section. If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall
            agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the ADR
            Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration except to the
            extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms. The AAA Consumer
            Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration are available online at
            adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration
            shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or
            disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten
            Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through
            binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party
            seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the
            award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more,
            the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules.
            Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your
            residence unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless
            the parties agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., the
            arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date,
            time and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award
            rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent
            jurisdiction. If the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater
            than the last settlement offer that the We made to you prior to the
            initiation of arbitration, the We will pay you the greater of the
            award or $2,500.00. Each party shall bear its own costs and
            disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal
            share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider. Additional Rules
            for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration. If non-appearance-based
            arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by
            telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions; the
            specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the
            arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal
            appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by
            the parties.
          </p>
          <p className="pb-4 text-[#acacac]">
            Time Limits. If you or the We pursue arbitration, the arbitration
            action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of
            limitations and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for
            the pertinent claim.
          </p>
          <p className="pb-4 text-[#acacac]">
            Authority of Arbitrator. If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator
            will decide the rights and liabilities of you and the We, and the
            dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined
            with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the
            authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim.
            The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages,
            and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an
            individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms. The
            arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision
            describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award
            is based. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on
            an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The
            award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and the We.

            Waiver of Jury Trial. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL
            AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A
            JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall
            be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement.
            Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient
            and less expensive than rules applicable in a court and are subject
            to very limited review by a court. In the event, any litigation
            should arise between you and the We in any state or federal court in
            a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU
            AND THE We WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that
            the dispute be resolved by a judge.

            Waiver of className or Consolidated Actions. All claims and disputes

            claims of more than one customer or user cannot be arbitrated or
            litigated jointly or consolidated with those of any other customer
            or user. Confidentiality. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding
            shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain
            confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph
            shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any
            information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an
            arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.

            no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the
            Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. Right to Waive.
            Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this
            Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the
            claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other
